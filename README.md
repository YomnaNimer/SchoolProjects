This repo contains two projects:

    - The first one is the Image Processing/Modification code, example of a picture is included before (Ibraham-lin.jpg) and after being processed (Ibraham-lin_35_lines.jpg) or (Ibraham-lin_100_lines.jpg). The code reads images using matplotlib library and represnts them using a certain number of horizontal lines of modified sinosoidal function with different intensities as shown in the code. Image "resolution" can be controlled by changing the number of lines as shown in both of the output examples. The image with 100 sinosoidal lines has better resolution than the image with 35 lines.  
    - The second one is the Finanacial Manager Tool and a snapshot of it operating. The finanacial manager is an ineractive tool that records transactions with the exact date and time. It asks you to input your recent transactions and categorize them as income or expense, by a series of questions. Overall, this program provides a simple yet functional personal finance management system, allowing users to track income, expenses, view transactions, analyze financial data, and plan a budget.
